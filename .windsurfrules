Project Details
Project Name:
Quick-Saver

Project Objective:
Develop a browser extension that helps Amazon visitors find cheaper versions of a product by scanning Amazon’s regional marketplaces or other retailers within Amazon itself. The goal is to save users money and improve their shopping experience with minimal effort.

Key Features/Functionality:
Product Comparison:

Automatically identify and compare product listings from other Amazon regions (e.g., Amazon UK, Amazon US, Amazon DE).
Include third-party sellers within the same Amazon marketplace.
Price Display Widget:

Display alternative pricing directly on the Amazon product page.
Highlight the cheapest option in a visually appealing and non-intrusive way.
Multi-Region Support:

Allow users to select which Amazon regions they want to compare prices with (e.g., US, UK, EU).
Shipping & Taxes Calculator:

Provide an estimate of shipping costs and taxes for products sourced from other regions.
Retailer Suggestions:

Suggest external retailers (if applicable) who offer the same product at a lower price.
Currency Conversion:

Automatically convert prices to the user’s local currency.
Affiliate Integration (Optional):

Implement affiliate tracking links to monetize the extension while providing value to users.
Target Audience:
Bargain hunters looking to save money while shopping on Amazon.
Global shoppers who frequently compare prices across Amazon regions.
Casual users interested in enhancing their shopping experience.
Tools & Frameworks:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or React for dynamic rendering).
Backend: Node.js (for price comparison logic, if required).
Web Scraping/Integration: Puppeteer or Cheerio (for price fetching), Amazon’s Product Advertising API (if applicable).
Browser Extension Frameworks: WebExtensions API (to support Chrome, Firefox, and Edge).
Data Processing: Currency conversion APIs like Fixer or ExchangeRate-API.
Optional Hosting (for advanced features): AWS or Firebase (if user preferences or cloud-based functionality are needed).
